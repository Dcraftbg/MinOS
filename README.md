# MinOS

MinOS is a mini operating system written in C.
(Minos is also the king of Crete in the greek mythology)

## Quickstart
```sh
cc nob.c -o nob 
./nob bruh
```

## Purpose

The MinOS is made to show my experience with Osdev so far and
to combine a lot of the things I like in an OS. 
As the name suggests the OS is "minified" into something minimalistic
and simple. The project is also meant to be used as a teaching basis from which 
other people can learn from as I try to display different aspects of osdev in
a more or less simple way (at least currently)

MinOS uses a lot of concepts that are based on Unix systems, but strives to create something which aims to provide speed and efficiency while avoiding some issues that many Unix systems have.

The OS is **not** Unix compatible (and doesn't have plans to be), even if it uses similar ideas.

## Progress & Plans

Progress is tracked over on trello where you can also find any plans for the future:

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions!

I love when the community helps in making something good, but I have to point out a few things.

Please don't make contributions that:
- Make something intentionally more obscure
- Add a huge dependency without much reasoning
- Implement or change an enormous part of the code and its structure (unless justified)
